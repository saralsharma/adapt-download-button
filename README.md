# adapt-download-button
<p>This button will download a file such as PDF without opening it in a new window/tab. This also shows an Arrow to point to the place where file is getting downloaded(*with some exceptions). For example in Chrome Arrow appears at bottom-left corner of the browser.</p><p>* The user can customise the position of the download button in the toolbar so Arrow.js won't necessarily point at the right location. IE11 and below versions have no support for the 'download' attribute</p><p>This component is using Arrow.js developed by Petar Bojinov.</p><p>Developed by Saral Sharma: saral.sharma@gmail.com</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saralsharma/adapt-download-button/master/download-button-component-screenshot.jpg" alt="Adapt-download-button component screenshot"/>
