# adapt-download-button
<p>This button will download a file such as PDF without opening it in a new window/tab. This also shows an Arrow to point to the place where file is getting downloaded(*with some exceptions). For example in Chrome Arrow appears at bottom-left corner of the browser.</p><p>* The user can customise the position of the download button in the toolbar so Arrow.js won't necessarily point at the right location.</p><p>IE11 and below versions have no support for the 'download' attribute</p><p>This component is using Arrow.js developed by Petar Bojinov.</p><p>Developed by Saral Sharma: saral.sharma@gmail.com</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saralsharma/adapt-download-button/master/download-button-component-screenshot.jpg" alt="Adapt-download-button component screenshot"/>
